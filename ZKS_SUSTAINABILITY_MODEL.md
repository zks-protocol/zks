# ZKS Protocol Sustainability Model 🌱

## Philosophy: "Privacy as a Public Good"

> **"Users never pay ZKS. Privacy is a right, not a product."**

ZKS Protocol operates on a radical principle: **zero rent-seeking**. Unlike token-based privacy networks, ZKS takes nothing from users. The protocol is free, open, and unstoppable.

But sustainable things survive. This document outlines how ZKS remains funded **without compromising its values**.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### What We NEVER Do:
- ❌ **No token** — No speculation, no gatekeeping
- ❌ **No user fees** — Privacy is free
- ❌ **No data monetization** — We can't even see your data
- ❌ **No investor control** — No VCs dictating roadmap

### What We DO:
- ✅ **Accept grants** for public good development
- ✅ **Accept donations** from believers
- ✅ **Partner with VPS** for referral income (users pay same price)
- ✅ **Offer enterprise services** (optional, for corporations)
- ✅ **Build community** that maintains itself
